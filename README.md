# ICE Data Science Common
This is the common repository for all algorithm development teams.
You should upload all code to collect data here, and basic hypotheses you would want to test.

"contest_data" contains the data collected for each contest.
"user_data" contains the data collecter per user
"hypothesis/your_hypothesis" should contain the results of your testing.

Use the "scripts/contest_data", "scripts/user_data" and "scripts/hypothesis/your_hypothesis" to upload your scripts alongside your result.
